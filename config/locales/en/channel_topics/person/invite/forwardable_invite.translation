INVITE
I'd like you to join %{business_name}'s texting group.

🏁 SIGN UP LINK (add your name to the text)
sms://%{app_phone_number_for_url}?body=%{code}%0A%0AAdd·your·name%0A@%3E

---

🆘 #{italic("If the link doesn't work, send a text to")} %{app_phone_number}. #{italic('Include')} \"%{code}\" #{italic('and your name following an')} @.

It should look like this:
%{italicized_code}
#{italic '@ Rosa Chan'}

Thanks!
